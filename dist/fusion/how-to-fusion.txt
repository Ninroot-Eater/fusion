The Idea
	Create a third csv files from 2 csv files. (given technical terms of mommmy.csv, daddy.csv and baby.csv. Daddy file is the one that is going to input the data to the mommy file. (so, like how reproduction works I guess?) Mommy file is the csv file that has all the registered students (the official sheet) or at least that's how it's assumed. So, we are assuming that everyone in the daddy file is in the mommy file, but not vice versa)

The Problem
	You can just copy and paste the whole columns from a csv file to another. However, not everyone in one file is gonna be in another. So, that's where Fusion comes in handy.

The Solution
	Each csv file has their own columns. However, they both gonna have the same type of column that is also unique for each row. (email in this case). By using the email addresses as keys, the Idea is achieved. 

The Process
	The program gonna ask you input. However, due to the development speed (2.5 hours), the program is very much not user-friendly. You should probably write the inputs down in a paper or something first. 

The Baby File Columb Structure
	email, name, p1, p2, p3, total, grade
